Time Complexity of Insert an item: 

The worst case time complexity of search and insert operations is O(h) 
where h is height of Binary Search Tree. In worst case, we may have to 
travel from root to the deepest leaf node. The height of a skewed tree 
may become n and the time complexity of search and insert operation may become O(n).
